## Description

This project aims to create a synamic and responsive website to showcase various events and allow users to browse and register for them. It utilises the Next.js framework, which provides powerful features for building modern web applications.

This is my first project using Next.js, and I chose it for its numerous advantages and capabilities. Some of the key advantges of using Next.js include:

- Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js enables server-side rendering, which improves performance and provides a better user experience by pre-rendering pages on the server and sending HTML to the client.
- Static site generation (SSG): Next.js supports static site generation, allowing you to generate static HTML files at build time. This enables faster page loads and reduces the load on the server.
- Efficient routing: Next.js provides an intuitive routing system that allows for dynamic and nested routes, making it easier to handle complex page structures.
- Built-in CSS support: Next.js comes with built-in CSS and SCSS support, allowing for easy styling and customization of components.
- API routes: Next.js provides API routes, allowing you to create serverless functions to handle backend logic and fetch data from external APIs.
